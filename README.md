# E-Commerce-BackEnd

Goal of this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I've created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. See Here ----> [youtube walkthrough](https://youtu.be/1XLW2FMWEHk)
